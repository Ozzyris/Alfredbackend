The place is literally underground, so much so that you can see the feet of the pedestrian walking up the street through the small window. Warm light and a mismatch of furniture give a cozy vibe. Its big advantage to me is that the fact than this place quiet enough to have a conversation which is rare in Sydney's bar. It is a bit crowded during the weekend, but you always found a place to sit, even a comfy couch if you are lucky. You can check their <a href=\"https://www.grandmasbarsydney.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> to know (a little) more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"selection\">Selection:</h3>\n<p>As the place is quite small, the selection is reduced as well. The cocktails are in strong majority with a big range of flavors. Some beers are also available but not on the <a href=\"https://www.grandmasbarsydney.com.au/Grandma'sMenu2016.12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">menu</a>, the same goes for ciders and wines. Ask a bartender who will happily list their available choices.

But in general their beers are around $8 and $17 for a cocktail. Their snacks, however are quite cheap, around $8, and they are big enough to give you enough energy to keep going.</p>\n<h3 id=\"location\">Location:</h3>\n<p>The place is only few minutes walk from Town hall station. It is really easy to miss as the entrance is the one of an housing building. No signs or any indication of the sort, but we usually help ourselves from the small windows at the ground level.<code>Chances are if you find a building in the block, with the entrance door open, you are in the right place.</code> You can easily confirm it when you see a deer head on the stair to walk down.

            "content_markdown" : "### Ambiance: \nGrandma's is one of my favorite bar, it simply feels like your friend's cave refurbish to chill and drink cocktails. The place is literally underground, so much so that you can see the feet of the pedestrian walking up the street through the small window. Warm light and a mismatch of furniture give a cozy vibe. Its big advantage to me is that the fact than this place quiet enough to have a conversation which is rare in Sydney's bar. It is a bit crowded during the weekend, but you always found a place to sit, even a comfy couch if you are lucky. You can check their [website](https://www.grandmasbarsydney.com.au) to know (a little) more.\n\n### Selection: \nAs the place is quite small, the selection is reduced as well. The cocktails are in strong majority with a big range of flavors. Some beers are also available but not on the [menu](https://www.grandmasbarsydney.com.au/Grandma'sMenu2016.12.pdf), the same goes for ciders and wines. Ask a bartender who will happily list their available choices. You can also find cheap snacks if you are hungry.\n\n### Pricing: \nTheir [menu](https://www.grandmasbarsydney.com.au/Grandma'sMenu2016.12.pdf) gives you the full list of prices which is probably the best way to check. But in general their beers are around $8 and $17 for a cocktail. Their snacks, however are quite cheap, around $8, and they are big enough to give you enough energy to keep going.\n\n### Location:\nThe place is only few minutes walk from Town hall station. It is really easy to miss as the entrance is the one of an housing building. No signs or any indication of the sort, but we usually help ourselves from the small windows at the ground level.` Chances are if you find a building in the block, with the entrance door open, you are in the right place.` You can easily confirm it when you see a deer head on the stair to walk down.
