			<h3>New Year Eve</h3>
			<p class="small">01 of January</p>
			<p>New year Eve is the celebration of the starting of the new year. Around Australia celebration may varie, but in Sydney the firework is the traditional way to enjoy the celebration. 2 main fireworks are organized by the Sydney council, the first one at 9pm and the second one at midnight. The fireworks are launch from the harbour from 2 floating barque and from the harbour bridge. The harbour bridge is closed during the time for the firework, making the trafic a real nightmare.This celebration is really famous and people camp around circular quai from early the morning to have a good view of the fireworks. Lots of parks around the bay are also privatise for the night forcing you to pay an enterance fee, some other would are free but would enforce a non alchool policy.If you never seen this firework we recommend to have a look as it is a impressive 20 minutes of explosion. But we also recommend to found a park around the bay, who would offer you a nice view and allow a quick transport to you next stop of the night.</p>
